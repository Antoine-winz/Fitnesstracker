Your duplication logic generally looks correct, so the issue is likely not within the loop structure itself. Common reasons why a "duplicate workout" route might fail include:

1. Missing or incorrect model fields  
   Check if the Workout model requires certain fields that are not being set. For example, if the Workout model has a date field that must not be null and you never set it in the original creation (or no default is provided), the duplicate might fail when inserting into the database. Ensure that all required fields for the Workout, Exercise, and Set models are properly handled.

2. Uniqueness or constraint violations  
   If there is a uniqueness constraint on the Workout name or another field, creating a copy with a similar name (e.g., "Workout Name (Copy)") might violate a unique constraint if a duplicate already exists. Verify your model constraints and consider appending something unique (like a timestamp) or removing the uniqueness constraint if not needed.

3. Relationship issues  
   Make sure the relationships between models (e.g., Workout to Exercise, Exercise to Set) are correctly defined and not causing attribute errors. The code relies on `original_workout.exercises` and `orig_exercise.sets` to iterate and copy items. If these relationships are not properly configured in your models with SQLAlchemy relationships, accessing them might fail silently or return empty results.

   For example, in your models, you might have something like:
   ```python
   class Workout(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
       notes = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
       date = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
       exercises = db.relationship('Exercise', backref='workout', lazy='dynamic')
   
   class Exercise(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
       workout_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('workout.id'), nullable=False)
       sets = db.relationship('Set', backref='exercise', lazy='dynamic')
   
   class Set(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       reps = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
       weight = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=True)
       exercise_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('exercise.id'), nullable=False)
   ```
   If these relationships differ or have not been correctly set, the duplication code will fail.

4. Data type mismatches for date fields  
   If your Workout model uses a Date field instead of a DateTime field, using `datetime.utcnow()` will cause issues. Make sure that the field type (DateTime vs Date) matches what you are passing in.

5. Front-end or request method issues  
   Ensure the route is actually being called with a POST request as expected. If the front end is not making the request correctly or handling the JSON response properly, it might appear as though the route is not working.

To debug further:  
- Check your server logs. The `app.logger.error` call in the exception block will reveal the actual error message.  
- Confirm the model definitions and constraints.  
- Verify that the route is triggered via a proper POST request and that the workout_id provided actually exists.

Key takeaways:  
• Validate all required fields are set.  
• Check for uniqueness or foreign key constraints.  
• Ensure relationships are correctly defined.  
• Inspect server logs for the actual error message.

If you can provide the model definitions or the exact error log from the server, it would be easier to pinpoint the exact cause.
